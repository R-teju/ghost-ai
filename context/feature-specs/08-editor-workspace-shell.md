Build the `/editor/[roomID]` workspace shell with server-side access checks.No canvas logic yet.

## Access

`/editor/[roomID]` must be a server component.

Before rendering:
- unauthenticated users redirect to `/sign-in`
- users without project access see `AccessDenied`
- non-existent projects also show `AccessDenied`

Create `components/editor/access-denied.tsx` with:
- centered layout
- lock icon
- short message
- link back to `/editor`

## Access Helpers

Create `lib/project-access.ts` with helpers for:

- getting current Clerk identity:`userID` + primary email
- checking project access by owner or collaborator

## layout

Build a full-viewport workspace layout with:

-top navbar showing the project name 
- navbar actions: share button and AI sidebar toggle
- existing `ProjectSidebar` on the left
- current room highlighted in the sidebar
- central canvas placeholder with dark background and centered message
- right sidebar placeholder for future AI chat

The canvas area should fill the remaining space.

## scope 
do not share real canvas logic ,liveblocks,AI chat ,or sharing bahaviour yet.

## check when done

-`/editor/[roomID]` builds successfully
- access helper exists outside the page component
- `AccessDenied` is used for missing or unauthorized projects
- workspace layout renders with current project context
- no TypeScript errors
